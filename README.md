## üìö How It Works

### 1. **Streamlit App**
The Streamlit app provides an interactive dashboard where users can:
- View a table of stocks with metrics such as price, P/E ratio, P/B ratio, and dividend yield.
- Select a stock to view detailed metrics, performance trends, and technical indicators.
- Recommendations (Buy/Sell) are color-coded for ease of interpretation:
  - **Green**: Buy
  - **Red**: Sell
  - **Default**: Hold (no highlight).

### 2. **Telegram Bot**
- Sends a summary of stock data to users via Telegram.
- Includes recommendations, intrinsic values, and industry benchmarks.

### 3. **Data Workflow**
- **Stock Data Retrieval**:
  - Fetches real-time data from Yahoo Finance API.
  - Includes metrics like stock price, P/E ratio, P/B ratio, and industry classification.
- **Industry Benchmarking**:
  - Scrapes data for industry averages of P/E and P/B ratios.
- **Recommendation Logic**:
  - **Buy**: P/E and P/B ratios are below industry averages.
  - **Sell**: P/E and P/B ratios are above industry averages.
  - **Hold**: Metrics are near industry averages.
